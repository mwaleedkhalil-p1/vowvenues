# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Deployment Issues Fixed

### Previous Issues:
1. **MIME Type Error**: Server was responding with HTML instead of JavaScript modules
2. **Blank Screen**: Static assets weren't being served correctly
3. **Build Configuration**: Mismatched paths between client and server builds

### Solutions Applied:

1. **Updated `vercel.json`**:
   - Proper static build configuration using `@vercel/static-build`
   - Correct routing for assets and API endpoints
   - SPA routing support for React Router

2. **Updated `package.json`**:
   - Added `vercel-build` script for Vercel deployment
   - Proper build commands for client and server

3. **Updated `vite.config.ts`**:
   - Fixed asset output configuration
   - Excluded development-only plugins from production
   - Proper chunk naming for better caching

4. **Updated `server/index.ts`**:
   - Added proper export for Vercel
   - Environment-based server listening

## Deployment Steps:

1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Configure build settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: `npm run vercel-build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
3. Deploy!

## Environment Variables:
Make sure to set these in Vercel dashboard:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- Any database connection strings
- API keys and secrets

## File Structure After Build:
```
dist/
├── assets/          # JS/CSS bundles
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
└── static assets    # Images, icons, etc.
```
